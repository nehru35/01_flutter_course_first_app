# first_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is the starting point for a Flutter application.

I'm excited to learn Flutter, and this is my first app! Currently, I'm taking a course on Udemy to dive into this exciting technology.

To help you get started with Flutter development, check out the following resources:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help with Flutter development, refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which provides tutorials, examples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
